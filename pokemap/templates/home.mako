Welcome! This is a little project of mine. For the moment, the only things to
look at are the maps&mdash;go find one and play around with it. They can tell
you what wild Pok&eacute;mon you can find in each area. Head
over to the <a href="/locations">Locations</a> page to get started, or
<a href="/about">read a little more<a/> about how the website works and about
me.
